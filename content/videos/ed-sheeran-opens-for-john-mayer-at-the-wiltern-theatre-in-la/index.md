After John Mayer opened for Ed Sheeran at the Gillete Stadium in Foxborough, Ed returns the favor and opens for John at the Wiltern Theatre in LA. The crowd was treated to two amazing artists performing their hits. Ed also joined John on stage for a beautiful rendition of "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room".
