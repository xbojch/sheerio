Hamish & Andy prepared a peep show with Ed Sheeran, but it didn't quite go to plan. Hamish was on the street persuading people to give it a go, but mostly they thought it's a scam. After some time people started to get interested, but they were not sure if it was a good idea. Hamish and Andy were trying to convince them that it was a good idea. The ones that showed courage got their money's worth.
