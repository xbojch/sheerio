After Khalid had to cancel his performance at the Gillete Stadium in Foxborough, Ed Sheeran asks John Mayer to open for him. John accepts under one condition, he can make and sell some funny t-shirts. He designs a t-shirt that says "Ed (in FedEx style) - the night John Mayer opened for Ed Sheeran". T-shirts sold out in minutes and the crowd got to see two giants on stage.
